Codes accompanying the paper ``Randomized K-FACs: Speeding up K-FAC with Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra'' (arXiv:2206.15397). 

## Citation
If you use the  code provided here, or any concept/results in the associated paper, please cite:

*[1] Puiu, C, Randomized K-FACs: Speeding up K-FAC with Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra, arXiv:2206.15397, 2022.

## Requirements
* Main files are standard Jupyter notebooks so will require an appropriate package. Works best with Google Colab and Google Drive (otherwise some editing is required)

* Python 3 (http://www.python.org/)

In addition, you will require the following python packages:

 * pytorch >= 1.11

 * torchvision >= 0.12.0

 * numpy >= 1.20

 * os, time, math of arbitrary versions

## Installation:
Manual: download, install required packages and run jupyter notebooks. Very simple if you just choose to use Google Colab.

## Documentation
* The main files are the jupyter files, one per solver considered in table 1 of the paper.

* The solvers (optimizers) themselves are placed in the Lib_files folder

* Reference Codes: optimizers implementation constructed by starting from the codes of https://github.com/alecwangcq/KFAC-Pytorch/
